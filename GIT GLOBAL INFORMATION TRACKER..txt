GIT: GLOBAL INFORMATION TRACKER.

VCS: VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM
it will keep the code separately for each version.

v-1	: 100 lines --- > store (repo-1)
v-2	: 200 lines --- > store (repo-2)
v-3	: 300 lines --- > store (repo-3)

REPO: It is a folder where we store our code.
index.html: it is a basic file for every application

v1 --- > index.html
v2 --- > index.html
v3 --- > index.html 


INTRO:
Git is used to track the files.
It will maintain multiple versions of the same file.
It is platform-independent.
It is free and open-source.
They can handle larger projects efficiently.
It is 3rd generation of vcs.
it is written on c programming
it came on the year 2005


CVCS: CENTRALIZED VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM
EX: SVN: it can store code on a single repo.

DVCS: DISTRIBUTED VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM
EX: GIT: it can store code on Multiple repo.

ROLLBACK: Going back to the previous version of the application.

GIT ARCHITECTURE:-
STAGES:
WORKING DIRECTORY: where we write our source code.
STAGING AREA: we track files here.
REPOSITORY: where we store tracked source code

--> Git workflow:-

* Developer creates a feature branch
* Makes changes & commits
* Pushes branch to remote
* Raises Pull request(PR)
* code review + Ci checks
* Merge to main/develop

--> Git workflow commands:-

* git init  - initialize empty repo
* git status - check file status
* mkdir directory name - create directory name
* cd directory name - change to directory 
* touch file name   - Create a filename
* git add .         - Add files to staging
* git commit -m "commit message" - to save chanegs
* git remote add origi <url>     - add remote url into local
* git push orign branch          - push to local to remote repo
* git pull origin beanch         - pull to remote to local or fetch + merge
* git branch                     - to check branch status
* git branch branch name         - create a new branch
* git checkout branch name       - switch to another branch
* git checkout -b branch         - directly create and switched to branch

CONFIGURING USER AND EMAIL:

git config user.name "raham"
git config user.email "raham@gmail.com"

NOTE: this user and email will be replicated to new commits only.

Git show: used to show the files which are attached to commits.
git log --online
git show commit_id

BRANCHES:
It is a individaual line of developemt.
developers write the code on branches.
initally baraches we create on git.
after write source code on git we push to github.
Default barnch is Master.
Note: when we do a iniatl commit the only default branch will be created.

Dev -- > Git (Movies branch) -- > code -- > github


COMMNDS:
git branch		: to list the branches
git branch movies	: to create the branch movie
git checkout movies	: to switch blw the branches
git checkout -b dth	: to create and switch dth at same time
git branch -m old new	: to rename a branch
git branch -D recharge	: to delete a branch

NOTE: to recover the delete branch

GIT PULL: it will get the branch from github to git
git pull origin recharge
git checkout recharge

PROCESS:
git branch movies
git checkout movies
touch movies{1..5}
git add movies*
git commit -m "dev-1" movies*

NOW PUSH THE CODE TO GITHUB:
create a repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/nayakdebasish091/paytm.git

PUSH: to send files form git to github
local: .git & remote: paytm.git
git push origin movies
